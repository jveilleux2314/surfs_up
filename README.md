# Purpose

I am wanting to open up a surf & shake shop so that I can move to Oahu and be able to live there. While getting advice from W. Avy - we decided to evaluate the weather data, precipitation, and the number of stations that are providing the data for Oahu. With this data, I will be able to determine if Oahu is an ideal location to open up a shop that surfing and enjoying ice cream will be successful. 

Although I pulled an entire years worth of data and analyzed it- I thought that comparing June and Decemeber would be a vast difference in season and ideal to compare how the season change will affect business.

Comparing the statistics of June versus Decemeber - 
  * They both have a good amount of data (June = 1700, Dec = 1517)
  * The average temperatures are both sitting within the 70's range
  * The tempurature that would most effect the volume of people that will come in to surf & eat ice cream would be the minimum tempurature- June = 64 degrees versus December = 59 degrees. Considering that is only a 5 degree difference I don't see a huge change between seasons but generally speaking 60's is pretty cold to swim/eat ice cream.
  * Both months have the max temperature in the 80's 
  * The median temperature for both months are in the 70's (June = 75 & December = 71)
  
 # Summary
 
Looking through the comparison of June versus Decemeber shows me that there is not a huge change in temperature and the season change will not greatly affect the outcome. 

I have calculated the precipitation statistics for the months of June and Dec to evalute if either month will be affected by the amount of rain.

Based off the Precipitation statistics comparing June and December - December has right under double the average precipitation than June does. This decreases the probability of a high outcome of customers likely to come into the Surf & Shake in the month of December. Although given the difference in comparison - the third quartile of both June and Decemeber are at 12% & 15% precipitation so the large "max" precipitation outcome could mean that the data set shows outlying days where the precipitation was significantly higher but 75% of the data of both months are very close in comparison. 12%-15% precipitation shows not a huge effect that precipitation will have on the outcome of customers.
